# The first honest Java library!

Honestlib is the first honest, tell-it-like-it-is library for Java! Now you
can find technical debt of all shades just by looking at the code. 

Classes that have dubious origins can implement the TechicalDebt interface and
you can tell immideately that something isn't right. 

Use the annotations to warn your fellow developers against traps, weird
constructs and plain old stupidity. Some features are added because they seemed
like a good idea at the time (and turned out not to be), some libraries have
been used since they seemed to be good, solid pieces of engineering but wasn't,
some features was implemented half-assed because nobody thought they would be
in widespread use (and they ended up being used *everywhere*)
